Used beside conventional cancer-fighting drugs, it could improve life expectancy, experts believe.
Following successful testing in mice, doctors plan to give losartan to patients with pancreatic cancer to see if it can tackle this hard-to-treat disease, Nature Communications reports.
Currently, only 5% of pancreatic cancer patients survive for at least 5 years.
This is partly because only one in 10 people with the disease has a tumour that is operable.
Investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the US are currently recruiting volunteer patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer to test out the new drug combination of chemotherapy plus losartan.
Although the treatment will not cure them, the researchers hope it will give the patients more months or years of life than they might otherwise get.
Losartan has been used for more than a decade as a safe blood pressure medication.
It works by making the blood vessels relax or dilate so that they can carry more blood, easing pressure.
The Massachusetts team found that the drug was beneficial in mice with breast and pancreatic cancer.
It improved blood flow in and around the tumours allowing more of the chemotherapy drugs to be delivered to their target.
Mice given this treatment, rather than standard chemotherapy alone, survived for longer.
Dr Emma Smith of Cancer Research UK said: "This interesting study in mice sheds light on why drugs for hypertension might improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy, but we don't yet know if they work exactly the same way in people.
The fact that these drugs are already widely used to treat high blood pressure will hopefully cut down the amount of time it will take to test their potential in treating cancer but they may not be safe for all patients or when combined with other cancer treatments, so we need to wait for the answers from clinical trials which are already under way.
BBC World News has won a prize for its coverage of the Syria conflict at the news and documentary Emmy awards in New York.
The series of reports, entitled Inside Syria's Uprising, saw journalists Ian Pannell and Paul Wood reporting from rebel-held parts of Syria.
The main winner was US broadcaster CBS, which took home 12 awards.
Channel 4 News and ITV also collected awards for news and current affairs at the same ceremony.
The latter awards were International Emmys, which were presented in conjunction with the news and documentary Emmys at Tuesday's ceremony.
Channel 4 News was the winner in the news category for The Battle for Homs, its coverage of the shelling of the Syrian city of Homs by government forces in February 2012.
Others nominated in the category included the GMA Network in the Philippines and Brazil's TV Globo.
The award in the current affairs category went to ITV for Banaz: An Honour Killing, which told of a young British Kurdish woman killed in suburban London by her own family.
Awards were presented in 42 categories in all, including breaking news, investigative reporting, outstanding interview and best documentary.
BBC World News beat stiff competition from major US broadcasters to take the accolade for news coverage of the Syria conflict, including CNN, NBC and CBS.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned against working with the Iranian government.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, he described President Hassan Rouhani as a "wolf in sheep's clothing".
He said Israel would not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, even if it had to stand alone on the issue.
Iran replied that it had no intention of developing nuclear weapons, and called Mr Netanyahu's comments "extremely inflammatory".
There has recently been a thaw in relations between the US and Iran, with Mr Rouhani and US President Barack Obama recently speaking on the phone together - the first top-level conversation between the two countries for more than 30 years.
But Mr Obama assured Mr Netanyahu on Monday that the use of force was still on the table in dealing with Tehran's nuclear programme.Iran's Foreign Minister Javed Zarif responded by criticising Mr Obama for what he termed "flip-flopping" on negotiations between the two nations.
In his address to the UN, Mr Netanyahu said Israel's future was threatened by a "nuclear-armed" Iran, and urged other nations to keep up sanctions against the country.
He accused Mr Rouhani of having the same goal as his more hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
"Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf's clothing. Rouhani is a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' Mr Netanyahu said.
President Rouhani has strongly denied that his government is seeking to manufacture nuclear weapons, but Mr Netanyahu said: "I wish I could believe Rouhani. But I don't."
He suggested Mr Rouhani was seeking to "fool the world", adding: "Rouhani thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it too."
He claimed that Mr Rouhani - in his previous role as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator - masterminded a strategy that enabled his country to move closer to developing nuclear weapons.
The deputy Iranian ambassador to the UN, Khodadad Seifi, said Mr Netanyahu's statement was "extremely inflammatory".
He said: "I do not want to dignify such unfounded accusations with an answer other than categorically rejecting them all."
Mr Seifi said Israel was the only country in the Middle East that was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), adding: "Israel has no choice but to accede to the NPT without any further delay and condition."
Tehran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, but last month the UN's nuclear agency said Iran had further boosted its capacity for uranium enrichment, installing more than 1,000 advanced centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment plant.
Iran is due to take part in substantive negotiations on its nuclear programme in Geneva on 15 October with a group of nations known as the P5+1, which include the US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany.
Mr Rouhani has said Iran will bring a plan to that meeting, but has not provided details.
The P5+1 have called on Tehran to halt production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20%. Uranium enriched to 90% is required for a nuclear weapon.
